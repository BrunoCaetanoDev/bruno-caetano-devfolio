  "PROFILE EPILOGUE": "My decision of pursuing a career in the area of IT is a result of my affinity for the development and deliverance of robust software solutions. The reality is that nowadays each developer must keep up with this worldwide community that aims to enhance, or in some cases, redefine the current practices happening in our current technological landscape.\nI currently contribute to corporate IT projects essentially as a microservice backend developer in the context of the Java programming language, where my strengths of cognitive logic development are best put to use, nonetheless, every so often I like to challenge myself with new experiences by working with new and interesting technologies.\nI sincerely think that perseverance is the key to perfection, so I embrace each challenge as a new opportunity for self-growth.",
