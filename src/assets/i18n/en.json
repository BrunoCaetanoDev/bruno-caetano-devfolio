  "PROFILE EPILOGUE": "My decision to pursue a career in IT is a result of my affinity for the development of software solutions. My first contact with the programming world came about during my college years, where I gained a good foundation of learning and interest in this area of â€‹â€‹knowledge.\nOver the years I have been progressing from the small introductory applications of \"ðŸ‘‹ðŸŒŽ \", currently contributing to corporate IT projects in E2E integration environments as a micro-service programmer in the context of the Java programming language. The development of backend applications has become my area of â€‹â€‹expertise, essentially because I have in good consideration the entire process of developing cognitive logic, but I do not deny myself new challenges, always looking for opportunities to incorporate new technologies into my project's context.\nIn spirit, I consider myself to be a real nerd, my interests range from heroes from books to comic books, from video games to movies on the big screen, but I also enjoy a good reading session, the Stephen King worship books are my favorites, and I make a free run to maintain my physical condition.\nI think perseverance is the key to perfection, so I face each challenge as a new opportunity for personal growth.",
